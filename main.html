        <p>When we talk about food waste, we may think of the food we throw away after cooking meals, or the uneaten food from our tables at fine dining establishments.
            <br><br>
            However, the sources of food waste are far more varied than this. Food waste includes lost or discarded food at all stages of the food system. Here are some important definitions related to food waste.

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p class="quote">The term ‚Äúwasted food‚Äù refers to any food that is not used for its intended use and must be ‚Äúmanaged.‚Äù</p></div><br>
                ‚ÄúWasted food‚Äù is the term used by the US EPA instead of ‚Äúfood waste‚Äù to express the value that can be recovered through alternative uses.
                <br><br>
                To properly implement tactics for food waste prevention as an effort to cutting global food waste, alternative uses for the food must be identified.
                <br><br>
                Wasted food comes from a wide variety of sources:
                <br><ul>
                <li>Unsold food from local markets or other retail outlets such as produce food</li>
                <li>Plate waste from restaurants</li>
                <li>Prepared, perfectly edible food that has not been eaten</li>
                <li>trimmings like food scraps from food preparation in restaurants, cafeterias, or homes; and by-products of food and beverage processing</li>

        <h2>Food waste and food loss: what is the difference between them?</h2>
        
        <p>There are a few different categories under the umbrella of wasted food.
            <br><br>
            üëâ ‚ÄúFood loss‚Äù refers to uneaten agricultural, forestry, and fishery products. It occurs during the food production and distribution stage. It is also caused by either a reduction in the quantity or quality of food.
            <br><br>
            This may occur due to various reasons. For instance, there may be disruptions in the supply chain due to fluctuating supply and demand or spoilage due to adverse weather conditions.
            <br><br>
            üëâ ‚ÄúFood waste,‚Äù on the other hand, refers to edible food that is intended for human consumption, but instead gets discarded or expires. This can occur in many different situations during preparation, sales, or food service. It includes plate waste, spoiled food, and discarded peels and rinds.
            <br><br>
            Rich countries waste the most, as do industrialized countries ‚Äì who often have a significant impact on this food loss and waste.
            <br><br>
            ‚ÄúFood loss and waste‚Äù is a term used to define the sum of both types of inefficiencies from unused food in the food system. This term helps researchers clearly explain the scope of their studies.

        <h2>What causes food waste?</h2>
        
        <p>
            Food loss happens at the production stage mainly due to insufficient skills, natural calamities, lack of proper infrastructure, and poor practices. Food loss happens before the food reaches the consumer.
            <br><br>
Food waste occurs when edible food is intentionally discarded by consumers after the food spoils, goes past the expiration date, or simply gets thrown away. 
<br><br>
At times, food waste can also happen due to overproduction. Overproduction occurs when restaurants, grocery stores, and other similar establishments order more food than they need, leading to an increase in perishable foods that are wasted. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/07/18/50-of-food-grown-globally-is-wasted-can-ai-fix-it/?sh=15c9e4293a14">Forbes</a> states ‚Äúoverproduction uses resources like fuel, water, fertilizer, increasing greenhouse gas emissions in the process. And then when food is wasted, you need landfill space and there‚Äôs even more CO2 production.‚Äù
<br><br>
On top of that, retailers tend to reject a lot of food because it doesn‚Äôt conform to their quality and aesthetic standards. According to the <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/35280/FoodWaste.pdf">UN Environment Programme‚Äôs (UNEP) Food Waste Index Report 2021</a>, 17% of global food production is wasted, with 43% of this waste coming from households, 26% from food service, and 13% from retail.

        <h2>Impact of food waste on the environment</h2>
        <p>A 2013 FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) report was able to discern a clear pattern in food waste at the global level. While middle and higher-income regions showed greater food loss and waste during the downstream phase (at the consumption level), developing countries were more likely to lose or waste food at the upstream phase due to a lack of proper harvest techniques and infrastructure.
            <img align="left" height="250px" width="400px" hspace="15px" vspace="15px" id="impact_on_environment" src="https://moveforhunger.org/application/files/3215/7229/0177/LandfillFoodWastePileGarbageTrash.jpg" alt="Heap of garbage with birds flying close to it">
            
            <br><br>
            The later the food is wasted along the chain, the greater its environmental impact because then we also have to take into consideration the energy and natural resources expended in processing, transporting, storing, and cooking it. If it was included in a list of countries ranked according to their greenhouse emissions, food waste would come in the third spot, right after the U.S. and China.
            <br><br>
            Food waste that ends up in landfills produces a large amount of methane ‚Äì a more powerful greenhouse gas than even CO2. For the uninitiated, excess amounts of greenhouse gases such as methane, CO2, and chlorofluorocarbons absorb infrared radiation and heat up the earth‚Äôs atmosphere, causing global warming and climate change.
            <br><br>
            With agriculture accounting for 70 percent of the water used throughout the world, food waste also represents a significant waste of freshwater and groundwater resources. It is said that the water used to produce just the food that is not eaten each year is three times the volume of Lake Geneva in Switzerland (with a total water volume of 21 cubic miles). By throwing out one kilogram of beef, you are essentially wasting 25,000 liters of water that were used to produce that meat. In the same way, over 1,000 liters of water are wasted when you pour one liter of milk down the drain.
            <br><br>
            Around 3.4 million acres of land, which is roughly one-third of the world‚Äôs total agricultural land area, is used to grow food that is wasted.

        <h2>What can be done to tackle food waste?</h2>
        <p>
            In 2020, FAO director Jose Graziano da Silva said, ‚Äúin addition (to) the environmental imperative, there is a moral one: We simply cannot allow one-third of all the food we produce to go to waste when 870 million people go hungry every day.‚Äù
            <br><br>
            <img align="right" src="https://moveforhunger.org/application/files/8816/4866/2434/CompostDirtyAndScrapsFoodwasteCrate.jpg" height="300px" width="450px">
To stop food waste, changes have to be brought in at every stage of the process ‚Äì from farmers and food processors to supermarkets and individual customers. As a first step, priority should be given to balancing production with demand. This translates to lesser use of natural resources to produce surplus food that will rot in the field.
<br><br>
Secondly, more effort should go into developing better food harvesting, storing, processing, and distributing processes. If oversupply happens, steps should be taken to redistribute the food or divert it to people who are in need. Though the UN says that food production will have to increase by more than half to meet the demands of the growing population by 2050, the actual increase would be much lesser if food waste was reduced.

<br><br>
Large restaurants, supermarkets, retail outlets, and individual consumers can also reduce their ‚Äúfood footprint‚Äù by identifying where waste occurs and taking steps to tackle the same, much like the City of San Diego did in January of 2022. Fruits which are misshaped or ‚Äúugly‚Äù are not necessarily bad and can still be bought and used in dishes like soups.
<br><br>
Consumers should also try to buy food in accordance with a meal plan so that they don‚Äôt end up wasting edible food. Food may be cheaper when you purchase in bulk, but in reality, you are not really saving money when all you are doing is chucking it in the bin at the end of the week.
<br><br>
If the food still ends up unfit for human consumption, it can be used for feeding livestock, saving precious resources that would have otherwise been used for producing commercial feed. If the food cannot be reused at all, then it should be used in compost or, at the least, recycled. The average home can divert about 330 lbs of food waste a year from local waste disposal facilities by adopting home composting into their day-to-day practices.
